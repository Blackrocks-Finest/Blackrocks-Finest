- Why hello again! Or hello there if you're new!

- Name: I am Dr. Subspace T.Mine, or just Subspace would work!
- 
- I am the current head scientist at Blackrock...
- ...Current interests are poisons, crystals, robots, and more!
- 
- I am currently undergoing the learning of artistic abilities, make things more interesting!
- 
- I used to have someone who worked with me, but...
- ...I would rather not work with that traitor ever again!
- 
- You can reach me via the game Pony.Town or on Discord at rotten_core_.
- 
- I see Pronouns as a silly and useless thing, but I'll use any of them!
- 
- The DNI things are the usual, and if people want to chat with me they can.
-
-  You can find me if you know where to look.
